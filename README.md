# Traffic Monitoring System using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time Traffic Monitoring System using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. The system is divided into two key modules:

1. **Vehicle Speed Detection**
2. **Number Plate Recognition System**

Both modules are designed to process video input, detect vehicles using YOLOv8, and carry out specific tasks such as speed estimation and license plate recognition.
